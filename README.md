# Eleventy Serverless Color Contrast Checker

![Screenshot of a browser showing a color contrast checker which reads "#4C1074 and #EE4433 have a contrast ratio of 3.37:1." The background is purple and red, reflecting the two hexcodes. A form with two color pickers allows the user to specify a new foreground and background and get the ratio.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FD7WPdPXoBEMGq5?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

I spoke at [Jamstack Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/JAMstack-Toronto/)'s 2021 edition of the [11ties](https://www.meetup.com/JAMstack-Toronto/events/281278073/) â€” a series of 11-minute lightning talks about the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator. In my demo, I showed how you can use Eleventy's new [Eleventy Serverless](https://11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless) feature to build a color contrast checker application that requires zero client-side JavaScript.
